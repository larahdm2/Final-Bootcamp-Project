# FBP | Skin Cancer Prediction

<p>
The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines whether a skin lesion is benign or malignant.
<p>
This project holds personal significance for me, as I witnessed a close family member's misdiagnosis and subsequent loss. It is my hope that eventually, we can develop a user-friendly application capable of accurately identifying all types of skin lesions in a timely manner.
This model currently achieves a 90% recall rate in identifying malignant lesions.

Please remember, always consult a doctor for professional medical advice and diagnosis.

   <h2>Description</h2>
  </summary>
<p>
The input images are from the HAM 10000 dataset: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T. Due to computer memory constraints, I divided the dataset into three subsets: one for modeling black and white images, another for modeling RGB images, and the third one for testing both.
<p>
The project requirements included web scraping, and I also incorporated insights from the World Health Organization webpage.

  The work is divided in 3 notebooks: modelling, scrapping and statistics.
  <p>
  The first notebook contains explanations regarding image processing, modeling, and conclusions. Since the image dataset is quite large, I kindly request that you download the images from the main source. During the process, I also created and saved arrays, which are also heavy, so I won't be uploading them either. However, if you wish to test the models, you can upload the attached model files.
