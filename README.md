   <h2>Description</h2>
  </summary>

The objective of this project is to create a deep learning model that classifies a skin lesion image into benign or malignant.
<br>
The input images are from the HAM 10000 dataset: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T. Due to computer memory constraints, I divided the dataset into three subsets: one for modeling black and white images, another for modeling RGB images, and the third one for testing both.
<br>
The project requirements included web scraping, and I also incorporated insights from the World Health Organization webpage.

  The work is divided in 3 notebooks: modelling, scrapping and statistics.
  <br>
  The first one contains explanations about the whole processing of images, modelling and conclusions. The images set is very heavy, so please, download the images from the main source. During the process I´ve also created and saved arrays , that are heavy too so I´m not uploading them neither. But if you want to test the models, you can upload the models attached.
